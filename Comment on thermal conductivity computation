The OCTP plugin uses the stress per atom computation of LAMMPS to yield the MSD of heat flux from which the thermal
conductivity can be computed. However, the OCTP user should be aware of the fact that the atomic stress approximation, as 
implemented in LAMMPS, may produce erroneous results in the case of heat flux when applied to systems with many-body 
interactions (e.g., angles, torsions, improper torsions). This results in incorrect thermal conductivity values. More 
details can be found in the work by Surblys et al. (PHYSICAL REVIEW E 99, 051301, 2019 - DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.99.051301).
